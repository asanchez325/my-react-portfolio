    "aboutme":"I have a diverse background and a thirst for knowledge. As an IT Project Manager, I initially began web-development to improve my technical skills and aid me in the workplace; however, once I started coding, I caught the love-bug- literally. The first bug I received when coding, resulted in hours of research, stress, more research, and an obsession to improve my skills. I enjoy the challenge and believe that if it doesn't challenge you, it doesn't change you. My diverse background has aided me in my developer journey and I look forward to continue learning and growing as a developer.",
